### Consuming Web Services via AngularJS ### 
***You will have seen me demonstrate the use of three different web services using angular ($http):***

1. Google Static Maps API
2. Google Geolocation
3. Weather Underground

The trick to several of these (2 and 3 above) is to use Angular's $http service to obtain a JSON response object from the service.

***You will re-implement my Weather Service app to do two main things:***

1. Use the DarkSky API to recreate some of the data strings provided by Weather Underground
2. Read the list of cities from a file - you should be able to add or remove cities

***Remember that you'll need at least three API accounts for this:***

1. Google Maps API
2. Weather Underground API
3. DarkSky API
